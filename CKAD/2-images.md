# Container Image Architecture

## Container Image Basics

- A container image is a tar file with metadata.
- It is designed for efficient image building and distribution.

## Layered Image Structure

- Container images are built using multiple layers.
- Base system images like BusyBox or Alpine are commonly used as the foundation.
- Application-specific layers are added on top of the base image.
- The layered file system combines all layers into a single file system.

## Benefits of Layered Images

- Layered images allow for efficient image building.
- Common components are shared across multiple images.
- Using layers reduces image size and speeds up image transfer.

## Managing Image Layers

- Docker and other container engines manage image layers.
- Overlay filesystem drivers, like OverlayFS, handle the layer management.

## Best Practices

- Reduce the number of layers in your container images for better performance.
- Minimize the size of each layer to optimize image building and distribution.
